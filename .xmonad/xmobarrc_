-- xmobar configuration file

-- Mess with this file to change the appearance of the contents of the
-- status bar which are not directly controlled by xmonad. You can see your
-- changes immediately by recompiling xmonad using "super-q".
-- 
-- There's a lot you can do here. Refer to "man xmobar".
